# imbalance-gain-causality

This repository contains the supporting codes for the article **Robust inference of causal links in high-dimensional dynamical processes from the information imbalance of rank statistics** (unpublished).

The functions employed to compute the Imbalance Gain in the paper are in the Python files _utilities.py_ and _imbalance_gain.py_, and their use is illustrated in the notebook _tutorial.ipynb_.

The codes require installing the packages NumPy (1.24.2), Matplotlib (3.7.0), SciPy (1.10.1), scikit-learn (1.2.1) and Joblib (1.2.0) - the versions reported are the ones employed in the analysis. The Information Imbalance is also implemented in the [DADApy package](https://github.com/sissa-data-science/DADApy).
